I decided to major in Management Information Systems because of the degree's flexible nature in terms of career options. It also combines knowledge from both business and technology (best of both worlds imo). This can lead to many job opportunities in various industries like healthcare, finance, or even retail. The degree provides high demand skills for a fulfilling career and a high-earning potential. But in honesty, I decided to major in MIS to work remotely.

1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards). A gallery selling unique art made from online artists like Lewis Rossignol, Sebastien Millar and Taylor Adams.

2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented? One potential shortcoming of my system could be security vulnerabilities. Since the system involves user authentication through login, registration, it’s somewhat safe. Additionally, there may be bugs or issues with certain features that were not caught during testing like the reviews that I had a hard time on. 

3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system: What I'm most proud of about my system would be the implementation of the shopping cart feature and the user state management using sessions and cookies. I think these are crucial features for any e-commerce website and I'm happy that I was able to successfully implement them.

4. Describe what you are least happy with your system: What I'm least happy with my system is that there were some bugs in the product ratings feature that I wasn't able to fix in time for submission. Additionally, I wasn't able to implement the search feature to the level of complexity that I had initially envisioned.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2? Developing this assignment was different from assignment #2 in that it involved more complex features such as sessions, cookies, and maintaining user states. It also involved more interactivity between different pages and features, which made it more challenging.

6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it? When I ran into a problem, I first tried to troubleshoot the issue on my own by reviewing the relevant documentation or code snippets. If I still couldn't solve it, I would reach out to my team for their insights and suggestions. If we still couldn't resolve the issue, we would escalate it to the instructor for help.

7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment? What worked well in doing this assignment was the collaborative nature of the project. Since there were several features that needed to be implemented, having a team to divide up the work and bounce ideas off of was very helpful.

8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment? What did not work well was the initial planning stage. We underestimated the amount of time it would take to implement some of the more complex features, which led to delays and unfinished features.

9. What did you learn from doing this assignment? I learned a lot about implementing sessions, cookies, and maintaining user states. I also learned how important it is to have a solid plan in place before starting to code.

10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change? If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would spend more time planning and estimating the time required for each feature. I would also try to address any bugs or issues as soon as they arose, rather than waiting until the end of the project.

11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging. 11. I would estimate that I spent around 30% of the time thinking about how to do something, 50% of the time writing code, and 20% of the time testing and debugging. 

12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”). I worked by myself.

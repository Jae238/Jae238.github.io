  <p><strong>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</strong> Through the experience of creating an ecommerce website that met all the functional requirements and applying good programming practices such as commenting, using descriptive file and variable names, employing good code formatting, and defining and using arrays and objects for item inventory, my programming skills have greatly improved. Additionally, the good data validation on the server and the use of plain input text boxes to select quantities helped me develop my skills in data validation and user interface design. Finally, managing inventory and implementing individual requirements helped me develop a deeper understanding of coding concepts.</p>

<p><strong>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</strong> While I have made progress in improving my programming skills, I recognize that there are areas in which I need to continue working. Specifically, I need to focus on developing my skills in problem-solving and debugging, as well as enhancing my proficiency in coding languages and tools. Additionally, I need to improve my ability to write clean, efficient, and reusable code.</p>

<p><strong>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</strong> I have found that working on WODs has been an effective way to learn programming concepts and improve my skills. By regularly practicing and applying these concepts, I have become more comfortable with coding and can now complete WODs without copying the screencast. This has given me more confidence in my abilities and encouraged me to continue practicing and learning.</p>

<p><strong>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</strong> The labs have been a valuable tool in helping me learn programming concepts and apply them in a structured environment. By completing the labs, I have been able to practice coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of programming concepts. As a result, I have become more confident in my abilities to solve problems and complete coding tasks.</p>

<p><strong>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</strong> Completing Assignment 1 was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to apply the programming concepts I had learned in class. Through this process, I was able to develop my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and coding languages and tools. Additionally, completing the assignment gave me the confidence to take on more challenging programming tasks, but I still feel a little bit anxious to work on Assignment 2.</p>

<p><strong>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</strong> While I have found the class to be helpful in improving my programming skills, there are areas where I think it could be improved. Specifically, I would like to see more one-on-one help and feedback from the instructor to better understand coding concepts and improve my skills. Additionally, it would be helpful if any unfinished labs, essential for completing assignment 1, were recorded for students to access in case we we are unable to complete the lab on time.</p>

<p><strong>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</strong> I have found that a combination of WODs, labs, screencasts, readings, and one-on-one help has been the most helpful in improving my programming skills. WODs and labs have allowed me to practice coding skills in a structured environment, while screencasts and readings have provided additional guidance and context for coding concepts. One-on-one help has been valuable in clarifying coding concepts and addressing any questions or issues I have encountered. Finally, working with classmates has provided an opportunity for collaboration and feedback on coding projects.</p>

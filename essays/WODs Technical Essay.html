  <p>In this assignment, I worked on Invoice1, where the task was to generate a sales receipt containing a minimum of five different products. To complete the task, I used expressions and variables to calculate the necessary values dynamically. It was important to avoid hard-coding computations and instead write code that determined the correct values based on the input variables. This approach allowed the sales receipt to adapt to changes in variable values. For more information, please refer to the provided link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html</p>

<p>For this assignment, I started by defining the variables for the different products and their prices. Then, I used expressions and arithmetic operations to calculate the total price of all the products, any applicable taxes, and the final total. Finally, I used print statements to display the sales receipt with all the necessary details and output into a table.</p>

<p>I found that one of the common stumbling blocks during my WODs was syntax errors, which could cause significant delays in completing the assignment. To avoid syntax errors, I made sure to have a good understanding of the programming language being used and double-checked my code for any potential errors before submission.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I found that having a good plan and approach to solving the problem worked well during the WOD. I broke down the problem into smaller sub-problems, tested my code regularly, and made necessary adjustments as required. This helped me complete the task within the time limit.</p>

<p>To prepare for this assignment, I followed similar steps as in previous WODs by reviewing programming concepts and syntax for JavaScript. However, what I did differently this time was tailor my approach to the specific requirements of the assignment. I made sure to carefully read the instructions and plan out my code accordingly.</p>

<p>To better prepare for future WODs, I plan to practice with similar assignments or examples beforehand. Iâ€™ll also seek out additional resources such as tutorials or online forums to provide additional support and help address any issues that may arise during the assignment.</p>
